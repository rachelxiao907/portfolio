    <span class="lb">StoryForge is a collaborative storytelling website that requires users to have an account to use the site. 
        It's a simple web application that uses Flask and SQL to manage user data.
        The main page allows users to login or register. After logging in, users can view any story they've contributed to. 
        They can also be redirected to create a story or add to a story. Once a user has added to a story, they cannot contribute to it again.
