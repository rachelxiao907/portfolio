        Four Toppings is a virtual boba tea shop that gamifies running your own boba shop.
        In this game, users will experience what itâ€™s like to take orders, make boab, sell boba to customers, manage inventory, and more!

        Using jQuery and AJAX from JavaScript, we handled the interactive portions of the web application by updating the
        database without refreshing the page when users make decisions in the game. Sending JSON data to the web server constantly 
        without new routes was a major part of this project.
