        Struggling to find the perfect song at the end of the day? Can’t quite put a finger on your emotions?
        Introducing Journalify, your new favorite tool for soundtracking your day. Write your daily journal entry on our 
        website and Journalify will generate a Spotify track based on your entry’s mood. No more endless scrolling: 
        Journalify takes you directly to the Spotify track and saves your entries (and songs!) for each day.

        Powered by a fine-tuned co:here language model, Journalify uses natural language processing to classify your journal entry into 1 of 6 emotions: happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, or love. 
        Journalify takes this emotion and suggests a song retrieved from Spotify's API, Spotipy. All of this information is stored in
        with SQL and Flask.
