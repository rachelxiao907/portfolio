        A version of the game Space Invaders done in processing. The player controls the shooter and tries to kill the aliens, which gives them points.
        The player must also avoid the bullets from the aliens or else they lose lives.
        There are also additional features that are not part of the original game like gifts which can give the player a fast bullet or a bomb bullet.

        By employing object-oriented programming, polymorphism, and data structures, we were able to create all the elemnts of the game
        and piece them together in a visual game board. For instance, a 3D array was used to represent each block in the barriers so
        the graphics of damaging it would be more realistic.
