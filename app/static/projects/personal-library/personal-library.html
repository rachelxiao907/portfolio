        An online library containing a personalized selection list of books and movies. Each user has their own personal library, 
        which has only the books and movies they added to. They can add these via a search or by looking through other usersâ€™ libraries.
        Users can mark a book or movie as finished or not finished. Users can also remove books or movies from their library.

        Bootstrap played a large role in organizing the libraries. We also utilized multiple APIs such as Google Books, IMDB, and
        Open Library.
