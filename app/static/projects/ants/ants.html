        A game where players take on the role of an ant queen and must defend their colony from invading bees. 
        To do this, the player must carefully choose which types of ants to place in the colony, as each type has a different ability or action it can perform. 
        The player must also deal with bees, which move through the colony and try to reach the end of the tunnel. 
        The game is won by defeating all of the bees, and it is lost if a bee reaches the end of the tunnel or if the bees destroy the QueenAnt.

        This project focused on focused on using object-oriented programming in Python.
        There were several core classes including GameState, Place, Hive, AntHomeBase, Insect, Ant, and Bee that ran the game.
        By implementing various subclasses, such as HarvesterAnts and ThrowerAnts, which many attributes to keep track of and creating a system to keep track of different locations in game,
        the game resembled PvZ.
